## Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze the sales data of an Amazon product to derive actionable insights for improving sales performance, understanding customer preferences, and optimizing inventory management strategies.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Data Exploration

The dataset contains sales data of the Amazon product, including features such as sales revenue, number of units sold, customer demographics, and purchase timestamps. Initial exploration involves understanding the structure of the dataset, identifying missing values, and examining summary statistics.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning processes include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers to ensure the dataset is clean and suitable for analysis. This step aims to prepare the data for further exploration and analysis.

## Analysis and Visualization

EDA techniques such as univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis are applied to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps are utilized to communicate key insights effectively.

## Insights and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, actionable insights and recommendations are derived to optimize sales strategies, improve customer engagement, and enhance inventory management practices. These insights aim to empower the product management team to make informed decisions and drive business growth.
